## About Me


I am Grishma, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background includes a dual degree in B.S.M.S. from IISER Bhopal, where I concentrated on pure mathematics with a focus on Algebra Geometry. Throughout my master's program at the University of Pittsburgh, I collaborated with Dr. Bard Ermentrout in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Presently, I am engaged in research with Dr. Hessam Babaee, exploring reduced order modeling (ROM).

## Research Projects

### **Completed Projects**

### **Project 1: Scalable Time-Dependent Basis ROM for Nonlinear SPDEs**
**Achievement:**  
Developed a reduced-order modeling framework achieving **1000Ã— speedup** over full-order models and **10Ã— improvement** over existing ROMs, with **99.99% accuracy** and enhanced numerical stability. The model adapts dynamically to rank changes, is robust to small singular values, and supports parallelization with minimal code intrusion.

**Description:**  
Time-dependent basis reduced-order models (TDB ROMs) are effective for approximating nonlinear stochastic PDEs, but their practical use is often limited by inefficiency for general nonlinearities, intrusive implementations, ill-conditioning, and fixed-rank error accumulation. We present a **scalable, robust, and minimally intrusive** method for solving TDB ROMs by projecting the full-order matrix differential equation (MDE) onto a small set of strategically selected rows and columns using **oblique projections** and **DEIM-based CUR decomposition**. This results in a method that is highly efficient, rank-adaptive, and parallelizable. Numerical validation demonstrates its effectiveness across a wide range of challenging problems.



### **Project 2: Geometric Oversampling for Enhanced ROM Accuracy**
**Achievement:**  
Investigated geometric sources of error in modern ROMs using **Riemannian manifold theory**, leading to a **novel oversampling strategy** that improves model accuracy while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude compared to conventional sampling. The technique was validated on nonlinear, stiff systems on finite element meshes, where traditional ROMs often fail to outperform full-order models.



### **Project 3: Seizure Prediction via Cortical Wave Modeling**
**Achievement:**  
Built a 1D spiking neural network model to explore **wave propagation in the brain**, uncovering mechanisms by which inhibitory control shapes cortical sensitivity. Developed a reduced synaptic activity model to study the **stability of healthy vs. seizure-like dynamics**, showing that loss of wave propagation can occur abruptly, providing insights into epileptic transitions.

**Description:**  
Cortical waves play a critical role in information transfer and neural responsiveness. We simulated these waves using a spiking neuronal network and validated our findings with cortical slice experiments. A mean-field model of synaptic activity was derived to explore transitions from normal to pathological states, demonstrating how spatial and temporal inhibition governs the stability and existence of wavefronts.



### **Project 4: Fifth-Year Thesis â€“ Vector Bundles over Riemann Surfaces (IISER Bhopal)**  
Under the supervision of Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh, this project focused on vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces, culminating in a proof of **AndrÃ© Weilâ€™s theorem**. The work involved constructing vector bundles from fundamental group representations and characterizing those of **degree zero** that originate from such representations.

### **Project 5: MarketMind: Unveiling Stock Trends with Machine Learning**

The stock market is inherently complexâ€”volatile, multifactorial, and often short on actionable signals. Our project tackles this challenge using advanced machine learning models, with a focus on evaluating **technical indicators** rather than constructing a trading strategy.

Our goal was to assess whether historical price patterns could be leveraged by machine learning to **predict future stock price movements**, offering **strategic insights** for analysts and traders. While not optimized for maximizing trading profits, our models reveal underlying patterns that challenge the assumptions of the **Efficient Market Hypothesis**, which posits that historical data holds minimal predictive value.

By applying rigorous **feature engineering**, **data preprocessing**, and **model tuning**, we observed that:
- **Continuous models** provide richer information but are more sensitive to market noise.
- **Classification models** are more stable and better at trend direction, but lack granularity.

Some of our models outperformed naive benchmarks, indicating the potential for well-processed technical data to yield **predictive edge** in certain market regimes.

### **Ongoing Projects**

### **Project 1: Domain Decomposition for Transport-Dominated Systems**
Developed a novel **domain decomposition** strategy tailored for transport-dominated phenomena like convection and shock waves. Achieved a **12Ã— reduction** in data size and significantly decreased computational time. The method supports **parallel computing** by independently solving subdomains, enhancing scalability and efficiency in large-scale simulations.

### **Project 2: Parametric Optimization Using TDB-CUR**
In collaboration with a colleague from the University of Waterloo and guided by a Master's student, this project applies the **TDB-CUR** framework to accelerate **parametric optimization under uncertainty**. The aim is to efficiently navigate large parameter spaces using low-rank surrogates for complex systems.

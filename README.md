## About Me


I am Grishma, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background includes a dual degree in B.S.M.S. from IISER Bhopal, where I concentrated on pure mathematics with a focus on Algebra Geometry. Throughout my master's program at the University of Pittsburgh, I collaborated with Dr. Bard Ermentrout in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Presently, I am engaged in research with Dr. Hessam Babaee, exploring reduced order modeling (ROM).

## Research Projects


### **Completed**

#### **Project 1: Efficient and Robust Low-Rank Modeling for Large-Scale Nonlinear SPDEs**

**Achievement:**  
Achieved simulation speeds **1,000× faster** than full-order models and **10× faster** than comparable reduced-order models, while maintaining **99.99% accuracy**. The method exhibited **robustness to small singular values**, **adaptability to rank variation**, and **high parallelizability**, offering exceptional computational efficiency with minimal intrusion.

**Project Description:**  
Time-dependent basis reduced-order models (TDB ROMs) have emerged as powerful tools for approximating solutions to large-scale nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). However, practical deployment is hindered by key challenges: (i) inefficiency with general nonlinearities, (ii) intrusive implementation requirements, (iii) numerical instability from small singular values, and (iv) error accumulation due to fixed-rank truncation.

To overcome these barriers, we developed a **scalable, robust, and adaptive framework** for solving matrix differential equations (MDEs) arising from TDB ROMs. Our approach leverages **oblique projections** and **CUR decompositions**, with row and column sampling performed via the **Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM)**—enabling near-optimal low-rank approximations. This results in a **minimally intrusive**, **rank-adaptive**, and **highly parallelizable** algorithm.

Extensive numerical experiments on challenging PDE systems—including those exhibiting stiff and chaotic behavior—demonstrated the method's superior performance in terms of **accuracy, stability, and efficiency**.


#### **Project 2: Geometric Oversampling for Enhanced ROM Accuracy**
**Achievement:**  
Investigated geometric sources of error in modern ROMs using **Riemannian manifold theory**, leading to a **novel oversampling strategy** that improves model accuracy while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude compared to conventional sampling. The technique was validated on nonlinear, stiff systems on finite element meshes, where traditional ROMs often fail to outperform full-order models.



#### **Project 3: Seizure Prediction via Cortical Wave Modeling**
**Achievement:**  
Built a 1D spiking neural network model to explore **wave propagation in the brain**, uncovering mechanisms by which inhibitory control shapes cortical sensitivity. Developed a reduced synaptic activity model to study the **stability of healthy vs. seizure-like dynamics**, showing that loss of wave propagation can occur abruptly, providing insights into epileptic transitions.

**Description:**  
Cortical waves play a critical role in information transfer and neural responsiveness. We simulated these waves using a spiking neuronal network and validated our findings with cortical slice experiments. A mean-field model of synaptic activity was derived to explore transitions from normal to pathological states, demonstrating how spatial and temporal inhibition governs the stability and existence of wavefronts.



#### **Project 4: Fifth-Year Thesis – Vector Bundles over Riemann Surfaces (IISER Bhopal)**  
Under the supervision of Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh, this project focused on vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces, culminating in a proof of **André Weil’s theorem**. The work involved constructing vector bundles from fundamental group representations and characterizing those of **degree zero** that originate from such representations.



### **Ongoing Projects**

#### **Project 1: Domain Decomposition for Transport-Dominated Systems**
Developed a novel **domain decomposition** strategy tailored for transport-dominated phenomena like convection and shock waves. Achieved a **12× reduction** in data size and significantly decreased computational time. The method supports **parallel computing** by independently solving subdomains, enhancing scalability and efficiency in large-scale simulations.

#### **Project 2: Parametric Optimization Using TDB-CUR**
In collaboration with a colleague from the University of Waterloo and guided by a Master's student, this project applies the **TDB-CUR** framework to accelerate **parametric optimization under uncertainty**. The aim is to efficiently navigate large parameter spaces using low-rank surrogates for complex systems.

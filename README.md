## About Me


I am Grishma, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background includes a dual degree in B.S.M.S. from IISER Bhopal, where I concentrated on pure mathematics with a focus on Algebra Geometry. Throughout my master's program at the University of Pittsburgh, I collaborated with Dr. Bard Ermentrout in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Presently, I am engaged in research with Dr. Hessam Babaee, exploring reduced order modeling (ROM).

## Research Projects

### Completed
Project 1: Time-dependent basis reduced-order models (TDB ROMs) have successfully been used for approximating the solution to nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). For many practical problems of interest, discretizing these PDEs results in massive matrix differential equations (MDEs) that are too expensive to solve using conventional methods. While TDB ROMs have the potential to significantly reduce this computational burden, they still suffer from the following challenges: (i) inefficient for general nonlinearities, (ii) intrusive implementation, (iii) ill-conditioned in the presence of small singular values and (iv) error accumulation due to fixed rank. To this end, we present a scalable method for solving TDB ROMs that is computationally efficient, minimally intrusive, robust in the presence of small singular values, rank-adaptive and highly parallelizable. These favourable properties are achieved via oblique projections that require evaluating the MDE at a small number of rows and columns. The columns and rows are selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), which yields near-optimal matrix low-rank approximations. We show that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a CUR matrix decomposition. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the new method for a diverse set of problems.

The method achieved simulations \(10^3\) times faster than traditional methods and $10$ times faster than comparable ROMs, with \(99.99\%\) accuracy and enhanced stability. The model demonstrates robustness in small singular value scenarios, adaptability to rank changes, and high parallelizability, ensuring computational efficiency and minimal intrusion.

Project 2: 	
Propagating waves of activity can be evoked and can occur spontaneously in vivo and in vitro in cerebral cortex. These waves are thought to be instrumental in the propagation of information across cortical regions and as a means to modulate the sensitivity of neurons to subsequent stimuli. In normal tissue, the waves are sparse and tightly controlled by inhibition and other negative feedback processes. However, alterations of this balance between excitation and inhibition can lead to pathological behavior such as seizure-type dynamics (with low inhibition) or failure to propagate (with high inhibition). We develop a spiking one-dimensional network of neurons to explore the reliability and control of evoked waves and compare this to a cortical slice preparation where the excitability can be pharmacologically manipulated. We show that the waves enhance sensitivity of the cortical network to stimuli in specific spatial and temporal ways. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of propagation and transitions to pathological behavior, we derive a mean-field model for the synaptic activity. We analyze the mean-field model and a piece-wise constant approximation of it and study the stability of the propagating waves as spatial and temporal properties of the inhibition are altered. We show that that the transition to seizure-like activity is gradual but that the loss of propagation is abrupt and can occur via either the loss of existence of the wave or through a loss of stability leading to complex patterns of propagation.

Project 3: Fifth Year Thesis Project under the supervision of Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh at the IISER-Bhopal(May 2016 - May 2017)
The objective of my project was to study Vector Bundles over Compact Riemann Surfaces. The goal was to study vector bundles and prove a theorem of Andre Weils . We constructed a vector bundle associated to the representation of the fundamental group of a compact Riemann surface and saw that the vector bundle is an indecomposable degree zero vector bundle. Now, there is a natural question that comes to mind: " Characterize those degree zero vector bundles that come from representations". Andre Weil’s theorem gives an answer to this question.

### Ongoing 
Project 1: We employ domain decomposition methods to pinpoint systems where the expense of solving the system globally far exceeds that of solving it locally within each domain. Leveraging our recently devised ROM technique, dubbed 'TDB-CUR', we tackle the system in a significantly more cost-effective manner. Domain decomposition inherently facilitates parallel computing, enabling simultaneous solution of different subdomains across multiple processors or computational nodes. Another application of domain decomposition is in tackling discontinuous systems, which we address through the utilization of SBP-SAT operators.

Project 2: We delve into the realm of Riemannian manifold theory to uncover the underlying causes of errors in state-of-the-art Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) techniques. Our exploration leads us to devise a novel oversampling approach, the efficacy of which we rigorously analyze.

Project 3: Conduct an examination into the stability analysis of the TDB-CUR method.

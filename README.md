## About Me


I am Grishma, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background includes a dual degree in B.S.M.S. from IISER Bhopal, where I concentrated on pure mathematics with a focus on Algebra Geometry. Throughout my master's program at the University of Pittsburgh, I collaborated with Dr. Bard Ermentrout in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Presently, I am engaged in research with Dr. Hessam Babaee, exploring reduced order modeling (ROM).

## Research Projects


### **Completed Projects**

#### **Project 1: Scalable Time-Dependent Basis ROM for Nonlinear SPDEs**
**Achievement:**  
Developed a reduced-order modeling framework achieving *\underline{1000× speedup}* over full-order models and *\underline{10× improvement}* over existing ROMs, with *\underline{99.99% accuracy}* and enhanced numerical stability. The model adapts dynamically to *\underline{rank changes}*, is robust to *\underline{small singular values}*, and supports *\underline{parallelization}* with minimal code intrusion.

**Description:**  
Time-dependent basis reduced-order models (TDB ROMs) are effective for approximating *\underline{nonlinear stochastic PDEs}*, but their use is limited by *\underline{inefficiency}*, *\underline{intrusiveness}*, *\underline{ill-conditioning}*, and *\underline{fixed-rank errors}*. We present a *\underline{scalable, robust, and minimally intrusive}* method using *\underline{oblique projections}* and a DEIM-based *\underline{CUR decomposition}*. The model projects the MDE onto a small subset of rows and columns, enabling *\underline{efficient, rank-adaptive, and parallelizable}* simulations validated across multiple challenging cases.

#### **Project 2: Geometric Oversampling for Enhanced ROM Accuracy**
**Achievement:**  
Explored the *\underline{geometric foundations}* of ROMs through *\underline{Riemannian manifold theory}*, revealing root causes of error in state-of-the-art methods. Developed a *\underline{novel oversampling strategy}* that improves accuracy and achieves a *\underline{tenfold reduction}* in computational cost. Applied it to *\underline{nonlinear, stiff systems}* on *\underline{finite element meshes}*, where traditional ROMs often match the cost of full-order models.

#### **Project 3: Seizure Prediction via Cortical Wave Modeling**
**Achievement:**  
Built a *\underline{1D spiking neural network}* to study *\underline{cortical wave propagation}* and its regulation through inhibition. Developed a *\underline{reduced synaptic activity model}* revealing how brain dynamics can shift to *\underline{seizure-like states}*. Demonstrated how *\underline{loss of inhibition}* triggers abrupt failure in wave transmission.

**Description:**  
We modeled *\underline{evoked and spontaneous waves}* in the cortex, crucial for *\underline{information transfer}*. A mean-field model helped explain how altering spatial and temporal inhibition leads to transitions between *\underline{healthy and pathological dynamics}*. Our analysis provided insight into the mechanisms of *\underline{epileptic seizure onset}*.

#### **Project 4: Fifth-Year Thesis – Vector Bundles over Riemann Surfaces (IISER Bhopal)**  
Studied *\underline{vector bundles}* over *\underline{compact Riemann surfaces}* and proved *\underline{André Weil’s theorem}* under the supervision of Dr. Sanjay Kumar Singh. Constructed bundles from *\underline{fundamental group representations}* and characterized those of *\underline{degree zero}* arising from such structures.

### **Ongoing Projects**

#### **Project 1: Domain Decomposition for Transport-Dominated Systems**
Developed a *\underline{domain decomposition method}* for *\underline{transport-dominated problems}*, achieving a *\underline{12× data size reduction}* and significant computational savings. The method supports *\underline{parallel execution}* of subdomains, making it ideal for *\underline{large-scale, high-dimensional simulations}*.

#### **Project 2: Parametric Optimization Using TDB-CUR**
Collaborating with a colleague at the *\underline{University of Waterloo}*, we apply the *\underline{TDB-CUR algorithm}* to large-scale *\underline{parametric optimization under uncertainty}*. Guided by a Master's student, this work aims to enable *\underline{low-rank surrogate modeling}* to speed up decision-making in complex systems.
